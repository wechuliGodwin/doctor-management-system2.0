            <p>"I was shocked at first‚ÄîI had never encountered such a condition before," recalls Juliah, Sarah's mother. This was her reaction upon learning that her newborn daughter would require surgery for a cleft lip and palate.</p>
            <p>Initially, Juliah sought help at another facility, where a pediatrician referred her to us. "Here, I received clear guidance on my daughter‚Äôs condition, including detailed instructions on feeding her properly to help her reach the required weight for surgery," she shares. "I felt encouraged. God helped me overcome my fears."</p>
            <p>After three months, Sarah was ready for surgery. She underwent a series of procedures, starting in January 2020 at just three months old and continuing through her first birthday. Today, Sarah is a healthy and confident five-year-old, back in school and thriving! "My daughter is happy and full of life," Juliah beams. "When I look at her now, I have every reason to thank God for all He has done."</p>
            <p>Juliah offers heartfelt advice to parents facing similar challenges: "Be courageous, trust in God, and don‚Äôt let stress take over. Focus on the treatment and the journey ahead. This is just a condition like any other‚Äîtake the child to a specialist and trust the process."</p>
            <p>Last month, the family visited our paediatric wing to share a cake and celebrate with the children and staff. During the celebration, Juliah expressed their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, Kijabe Hospital, for the wonderful work you‚Äôre doing. The smiles you bring to our faces are truly a blessing.'"</p>
