            Kijabe Mission Station was first established by missionaries from Africa Inland Mission (AIM) as an outpost in 1915. The name "Kijabe" is a Masai word meaning "Place of the Winds," reflecting the area's strong winds and unique climate at an altitude of 7,200 feet on the edge of the Great Rift Valley.

        <p>
            The first hospital at Kijabe, Theodora Hospital, was established in 1915 within the grounds of Rift Valley Academy. It served the medical needs of the area until the present complex was begun. The first building of the current complex was opened in 1961. Over the years, the hospital has grown tremendously, now operating as a non-profit, 363-bed facility owned and operated by the Africa Inland Church (AIC) Kenya. It is situated in rural Kenya, about an hour's drive from Nairobi towards Nakuru.

            Kijabe Hospital's mission is to "Glorify God through compassionate health care provision, training, and spiritual ministry in Christ Jesus." This mission is reflected in its approach to patient care and community outreach. The hospital is a faith-based institution sponsored by AIC Kenya and is part of a network that includes four hospitals and 45 dispensaries located throughout Kenya.

It includes five inpatient wards: general surgery, medicine for adults and children, obstetrics and gynecology, neonatal care, and rehabilitation.

            Kijabe Hospital is renowned across Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa for several reasons. One significant aspect is the spiritual component of healthcare provided. Many patients choose Kijabe because they want doctors who will not only treat them but also pray for them, acknowledging the importance of spiritual healing alongside physical treatment.
        </p>

        <p>
            The hospital is also known for its excellence in orthopaedic and general surgery. This reputation may stem from its first surgeon, Dr. Bill Barnett, an orthopaedic specialist, and is bolstered by the ongoing needs arising from road traffic accidents in Kenya. The proximity to AIC Cure Hospital, which specializes in pediatric orthopaedics, and the presence of PAACS (Pan-African Academy of Christian Surgeons) residency programs contribute to its surgical excellence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maternity and neonatal care are other areas where Kijabe Hospital excels. It is widely recognized as the best place in Kenya for high-risk pregnancies, especially for expectant mothers carrying multiples such as twins or triplets. This reputation dates back to the early days of the hospital and continues to attract patients from all over the country.
        </p>

            In recent years, Kijabe Hospital has developed a strong reputation for cancer care. Starting with excellent surgical and pathology capabilities, the hospital has rapidly expanded its oncology, palliative care, and diagnostic services to meet the growing cancer burden in Kenya. Trust in Kijabe as a cancer care provider has significantly increased, leading to further developments such as the construction of a new Kijabe Cancer Center.
        </p>

        <p>
            The hospital employs over 900 staff members, striving to balance Kenyan and missionary consultants. It also plays a vital role in training nurses, medical students, and specialists, contributing to the development of healthcare professionals in the region. Training programs include basic and advanced nursing, surgical specialties, anesthesia, family medicine, pediatrics, HIV care, and more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kijabe Hospital serves a diverse population, primarily the Kikuyu people, though the number of Maasai patients has increased. Swahili and English are the official languages of Kenya, and all medical staff are fluent in English. Nurses provide translation to Swahili or Kikuyu as needed, ensuring effective communication with patients.
        </p>

            The hospital provides Community Health Evangelism (CHE) and chaplaincy programs, emphasizing the integration of spiritual care with medical treatment.
